# Cryptography course 2020-1 FI UNAM

My approach to the problems given in the Cryptography course imparted by Dr. Aldeco-Perez in the 2020-1 semester of Computer Engineering. I also included the written materials for further reference, all of them credited to their respective authors.

Please just take this as a reference, do not straight out copy this, although I'm not responsible for your actions. 

BE CONSCIOUS.
